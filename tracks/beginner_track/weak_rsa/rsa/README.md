# Rsa

This is a simple example to understand a little bit better RSA protocol, the following information I got from "Master the security of Stream Ciphers, Block Ciphers, Key Exchange, Public Key, Signatures, Shadow files all with Python" a Udemy course.

In this example there is an example of [Integer factorization and RSA proble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Integer_factorization_and_the_RSA_problem).

To run it:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Notice: sometimes the script doesn't decrypt correctly.
