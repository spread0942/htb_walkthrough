# Hack the Box Write-ups

Welcome to my Hack the Box repository! This repo showcases my journey through various Hack the Box challenges, detailing the steps and techniques I used to solve them. This serves as a testament to my skills in penetration testing and cyber security.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document my problem-solving process, demonstrate my technical abilities, and serve as a resource for others who might be stuck on similar challenges. By sharing my approach, I hope to contribute to the learning community and help others develop their skills.

## Structure

* README.md: This file, explaining the purpose and structure of the repository.
* machines/: This directory contains subdirectories for each machine I've successfully hacked.
    * Machine-Name/: Each subdirectory includes detailed write-ups, scripts, and any other relevant files.

## Usage

Feel free to use these write-ups as walkthroughs or references. If you get stuck on a challenge, my notes might provide the insight you need to progress. However, I encourage you to attempt solving the challenges independently before referring to these solutions, as the real learning comes from the problem-solving process.
